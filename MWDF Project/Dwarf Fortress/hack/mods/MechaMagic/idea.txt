phylactery:
    a building that binds to unit, while building is working/functional unit will nOt DIE!!!
    could respawn in this building (more and more undead)
    or just raise in the spot
    !!! could use some body part of original creature !!!
    or blood of it...

some chance to:
    mood it (e.g. berserk)
    undead it (zombie)
    husk it (oh noez)
    set on fire?
    blast noxious fumes

other ideas:
    firemen creator (compresses lava and (something magical) into a firemen, or maybe eggs)
    various extractors (e.g. heart? blood? and so on... used by other machines)
    obelisk:issues jobs to nearby undead
    golems and their controller (difference: always friendly, can have more complex control)
    cryogenic levitation: check if its still possible to hang unit in place by setting up projectile
    a workshop that creates a vein: maybe arming it would involve adding boulders (X boulders for X tiles to fill)
    boosting the tree/plant growth: quick way to tree farm! (misfire: spawn a berserk ent?)
    teleportation machine
