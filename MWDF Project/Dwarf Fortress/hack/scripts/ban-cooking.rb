ban-cooking
===========
A more convenient way to ban cooking various categories of foods than the
kitchen interface.  Usage:  ``ban-cooking <type>``.  Valid types are ``booze``,
``honey``, ``tallow``, ``oil``, ``seeds`` (non-tree plants with seeds),
``brew``, ``fruit``, ``mill``, ``thread``, and ``milk``.
