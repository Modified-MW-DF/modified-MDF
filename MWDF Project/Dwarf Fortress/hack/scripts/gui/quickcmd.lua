--- Simple menu to quickly execute common commands.
--[====[

gui/quickcmd
============
A list of commands which you can edit while in-game, and which you can execute
quickly and easily. For stuff you use often enough to not want to type it, but
not often enough to be bothered to find a free keybinding.
