Soft little fleshy-things? Here?
Nuisances, nuisances!
I'll crush you underfoot!
Come, gnats: to your death!
You will be crushed!
I will roast you alive!
You shall be cleansed by fire!
Your flesh will blacken and char!
You shall burn!
Burn!
I want to watch you burn!
EVERYTHING SHALL BURN!!
Your bones will blacken!
Bathe in FLAME!!
Flame finds all!
Fire and fury!
Pigs will roast!
Ashes to ashes!
I will reduce all to ashes!
Like moths to the flame!
Only your ashes will remain!
Burn beneath my molten fury!
RUN AND HIDE!!!
By fire be purged!
Die, insect!
