a slimy creature unworthy to even be a housepet
whose scales now decorate my cloak
whose venom couldn't affect me
who should have slithered back under the rock [PRO_SUB] came from
whose fangs made a fine necklace
who blindly sacrificed [PRO_POS] own life for [PRO_POS] empress
whose stench was actually more pleasant after [PRO_POS] death
