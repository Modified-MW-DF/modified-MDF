Cry Havoc!
By the light of the moon!
All too easy.
Goddess, light my path.
Fear the night!
Pray for dawn!
Come and get it!
For the Great Mother!
The hunt is on!
They don't stand a chance!
No quarter!
Make your peace!
I'll make short work of them!
Victory is at hand!
By the spirits!
Death to all defilers!
None shall harm the wilds!
Smite the defilers of the land!
Strike!
For the Goddess!
None shall survive!
Your blood is mine!
Run for your life!
Let justice be served!
They shall not escape!
Justice has come!
I shall be your executioner.
Die, fool.
You'll regret approaching me.
None may challenge me.
Cry for mercy!
For justice!
The end draws near.
