You only waste my time!
My hunger knows no bounds!
I am invincible!
Enough distractions!
I must feed! Prepare to die!
Take heart! Your friends will not long mourn your passing!
Foolish whelp!
I will consume your energies and then your soul!
This world shall burn!
You will drown in your own blood!
