Nothing shall remain.
Fall, molder, and begone.
I have raged, and wrought destruction.
Repent the folly of ascribing meaning to the void.
Be cast into nothingness.
In hate's demise...freedom.
Slave to a broken order, dare you look upon the truth?
I have seen the scattering of countless myriad souls... they gather and flow to become as the river of time, expanding to fill the firmament.
What a base and trifling creature is man... yet at once is he the master of this empyreal flow, grand as all the heavens.
I bid you, hone your spirit. Refine it. I shall await you in the crucible of souls.
