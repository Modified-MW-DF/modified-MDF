Your soul will be mine.
My patience with you is wearing thin...
Your Hell awaits you.
Suffering and pain waits for you.
Death will not be your end...
Your soul will burn in Hell forever.
For every step you take, your soul moves closer to me...
There is nothing left for you, but a slow death.
You will not escape me.
This fight has only just begun.
Welcome to your death, mortal.
Worthless mortal.
