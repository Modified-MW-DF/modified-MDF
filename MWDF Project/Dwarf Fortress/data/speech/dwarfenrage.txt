Take that, you sod!
For the king!
This battle is over!
Take this, you bastard!
Death!
For victory!
Death comes for ye!
I'll run 'em through!
To arms!
What's this?!
What the bloody hell are you playing at?
Let's get pissed!
Spears, blood, booze and thunder!
I'll play your game, you rogue.
Come on and fight, ye wee ninny!
I'm gonna enjoy killing these slack-jawed daffodils!
Oh no ye don't, boy!
Stand down,  ye dull-witted twirlybird!
Kiss me arse, ye soft-noggined nancy boy!
Is that the best ye can do?
I've met gnomes who are tougher than you.
