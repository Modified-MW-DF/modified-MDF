You will feed the swarm.
You disturb the swarm.
The swarm will enjoy your death.
As you suffer, we enjoy.
The swarm requires sustenance.
The swarm will consume you.
We shall feast on your guts.
Your life is forfeit.
You are brave despite the odds.
The swarm will feast on your corpse.
You are merely another victim.
The bag of meat will spring a leak.
Do we make you uncomfortable?
You're a fool to confront us.
Yours will be a painful death.
You will incubate my young.
Inferior being.
The swarm mocks you.
The swarm is pleased to end you.
The swarm will ensure your death.
We are the swarm. We bring death.
The swarm prefers solitude.
The swarm is eager to feed.
