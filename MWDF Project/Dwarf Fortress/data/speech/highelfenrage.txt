You dare threaten me?
You'll regret ever entering our land.
Come taste the wrath of the elves.
You asked for it!
Nowhere to hide!
Cower, knave!
Ride the lightning!
I'll level you!
Strike!
Choke on this!
Accept the pain!
No retreat!
Now victory shall be ours!
Now, feel my wrath!
Begone, spawn of darkness!
By the power of the Light, burn!
For the memory of our people!
