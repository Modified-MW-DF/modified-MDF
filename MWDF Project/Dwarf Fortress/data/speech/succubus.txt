who I sent back to the abyss where [PRO_POS] kind belong
whose depraved ways has led [PRO_OBJ] to [PRO_POS] doom
who tried to make me [PRO_POS] pet with no success
who was not my style
now a beautiful corpse
who tried to fly but failed
no monster from the darkness could have saved [PRO_OBJ]
I bet it felt good for [PRO_OBJ]
who now suffer in the underworld among [PRO_POS] kin
