We'll stain our hands with your blood!
At last! A warm-up!
You dare challenge us? You are a fool.
Face us, and we will see who is stronger.
We will make you beg for mercy.
Begone from our sight!
You have earned our wrath!
Our power knows no limit!
Your presence bores us.
We tire of this. Begone!
