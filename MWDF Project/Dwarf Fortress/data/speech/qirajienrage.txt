Prepare!...for the return of the ancient ones!
Cower, mortals! The age of darkness is at hand!
The screams of the dying will fill the air!
A symphony of terror is about to begin!
Spineless wretches!
You will drown in rivers of blood!
Tremble! The end is upon you!
Are you so eager to die? I will be happy to accomodate you...
Crush them, drive them out!
Do not hesitate, destroy them!
You are not worth my time!
Breath your last!
Impudent fool!
I will kill you myself!
Fear is for the enemy! Fear and death!
I sentence you to death!
I serve to the last!
The laws of the Ancients will not be challenged!
Prepare to embrace oblivion!
Ah, lambs to the slaughter.
Let none survive!
It's too late to turn away.
The feast of souls begins now...
You will not escape death!
Your fate is sealed!
