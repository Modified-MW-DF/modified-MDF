No amount of fighting will save you.
See you on the flipside...
This is going to cost you an arm and a leg.
You walk into my home with no offerings? How disrespectful...Time to teach you some manners.
You'll be my next export...sunshine.
You're all the same...you just want what's mine!
This place is my property! Mine! MINE!!!
I'm as avaricious as can be...and right now I want your life.
I want everything you can possibly imagine...money, women, status, glory. Your pathetic attempts at heroism won't deny me that.
I deserve more! And I will get it, wheter you worthless "heroes" like it or not!
This entire world shall belong to me!
You're going to pay for this insolence.
Pay me with a pound of your own flesh, and I'll let you go.
