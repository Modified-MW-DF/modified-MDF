Do you even have some food with you?
After I kill you, I'm just gonna leave you there.
Uuuugh, I've had enough of you! Die already!
I don't care much for trespassers.
Will you hurry up and die so I can take a nap?
It's okay to quit. Go on! Do it!
You're really wearing me out...
I really need to rest now so can you just leave?
Fine, you don't want to leave? Don't. Ever.
Give it up. It's pointless.
Take a load off, and die.
I don't know why you're bothering me.
*yawn* Oh, sorry. Did you want something?
You should just give in, you know.
Why can't you just let me nap?
