<h1>Plump Helmet Men</h1>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time,
averaging 5 per female.&nbsp; If you're not careful, they may
attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their
numbers quickly enough.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate
area.&nbsp; If they realize that they are the majority, they will
rebel.&nbsp; It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they
are the majority.&nbsp; This has no visible effect at first.</p>
<p><br />
- A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.&nbsp; They
will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping
creatures.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like
vampires.&nbsp; This effect lasts for half a year after the
rebellion actually starts.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the
creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run
away.&nbsp; Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once,
so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly
outnumbered.</p>
<p><br />
- Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going
berserk.&nbsp; Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were
not the actual target.</p>
<p><br />
- Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance
of inflicting necrosis on themselves.&nbsp; This will generate
miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture,
because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
<p><br />
- Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky
strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they
will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
<p><br />
- Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is
now docile.&nbsp; However, they may choose to attack one on their
own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the
ones that made a kill).</p>
<p><br />
- Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
<p><br />
- The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture
them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the
dwarves that pass by.&nbsp; Large numbers of tame animals can also
prevent PHM from rebelling.&nbsp; Separating them into small groups
can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of
guards that have been in combat.&nbsp; Or you could go the simplest
method: just eat them!</p>

<p>General info: </p>

  <li>Many creatures give pelts when butchered, giving furs after tanning.</li>
  <li>All animals give leather relative of their size. A cat gives 1, a oxen gives 7.</li>

</ul>
<h1 align="left">Succubi - Pets</h1>
<h2><strong>Summoning creatures</strong></h2>
The creatures described here can be acquired at the summoning circle in
exchange of various items, mainly souls (obtained either by butchering
or by running the gathering soul reaction as the Soul Well). Some of
those creature are not tame whan summoned. This means that they will
act friendly, but cannot be trained or assigned to an owner until tamed.<br />
<br />
In order to tame a creature, you must build an empty cage. Then you
must design an activity area over it (i) and activate the
'animal&nbsp; training' activity. Put the creature inside the cage
then assign it a trainer on the animals screen (z then enter). Once
tame, you can free the creature by linking the cage to a lever and pull
it.<br />
<br />
Be warned that the creature may turn hostile if it forget its training.
Hopefully the succubi learn the training job at a fast rate to
compensate this extra job. In any case, not training a creature still
allow to complete any role that is not associated to one particular
inhabitant of your fort.<br />
<br />
The succubi and the pets are immune to each other's syndromes, so
friendly fire will not be an issue.<br />
<br />
One thing to note that there is an unfixable bug concerning caravan,
all slaver merchants (Orcs, Drows, Goblin, Succubi) will 'kidnap' the
pets they bring. You will be spammed by kidnapping messages but no
creature of your fort will be lost. However, this means that sold
creatures will not count towards your exports. If you wish to raise
wealth, you will be better off butchering valuable beasts to make
crafts.
<h2><strong>The pets</strong></h2>
These common creatures can be bought from caravans or the embark screen.<br />
<h3><strong><img src="pets/nahash.png" width="15" height="15" alt="pet" /></strong> Nahash - Hunts vermin, adopts owner, lay eggs (female) <strong>::: Price: 101 ::: </strong></h3>

burn there or; with a few tricks, can be placed at strategic spots.

<h3><strong><img src="pets/nightmare.PNG" width="16" height="16" alt="pet" /></strong> Nightmare</h3>
