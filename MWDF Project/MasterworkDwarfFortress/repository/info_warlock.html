                <h1 align="left"><a name="aa" id="aa">Warlocks</a></h1>
                <p align="left">Witches and Warlocks are the rulers of your dungeon. They need to eat, drink and sleep like any other creature, but they are immortal and don't age. When a warlocks body dies, take good care of the corpse, because it is possible to bring them back from the dead. This power comes at a price. Warlocks can not reproduce in the traditional way, there are no children.</p>
                <p align="left">Warlocks are natural necromancers and can raise the dead around them, if told to do so. They fight with wraithblades and magestaves, having a natural skill in those weapons. They detest normal weaponry and wont learn these skills.</p>
                <p align="left">They do shy away from manual labor, and mostly to Research, Writing, Alchemy and Chemistry, Herbalism, Medical Experiments, Working with Gems, Trading and what they might call 'Diplomacy', which consists of luring other races to their dungeons.</p>
                <p align="left">Warlocks are the only caste that can become a noble, with the exception of the Steward.</p>
                <p align="left">Their main weapon is magic. In the extensive libraries they can learn  different spells, from all schools of magic.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <h1 align="left"><a name="bb" id="bb">Skeletons</a> &amp; Zombies</h1>
                <p align="left">The backbone of your fort. Skeletons and Zombies do most of the menial labors, like woodcutting, mining and crafting. They are unable to learn new skills and move rather slowly. They never eat, drink or sleep, making them a cheap workforce.</p>
                <p align="left">Immune to stun, exertion, fevers, poisons and most other status effects, they are a slow and methodical army. </p>
                <p align="left">Zombies never learn any combat skills, while Skeletons learn combat skills with a 50% learn-rate, with the exception of whips.</p>
<p align="left">You can animate corpses into new zombies, or build new skeletons from bones, animating them with a soul. You can add new skills to Skeletons at the Inscriptors Workshop. Skeletons come with natural mining and bonecarving skills. Zombies cant get any skills.</p>
                <p align="left">Skeletons come in 4 castes: Bone, Bonemold, Bloodsteel and Dreadnought. Each caste gets 2 points in natural skills and 25% higher learn rates than the previous. Their bones are made of the materials, which essentially gives them natural armor. The natural ratio is 1000:100:10:1, but you can manufacture your own upgraded skeletons in the Corrupted Forge.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <h1 align="left"><a name="cc" id="cc">Ghouls</a></h1>
                <p align="left">Ghouls are vicious, corpse-eating creatures. They need to eat meat, drink and sleep. Unlike your skeletal servants, ghouls move very quickly. They have natural butcher skills and make good shock-troopers, having natural skill for whips. </p>
                <p align="left">Ghoul saliva turns bitten creatures into zombies after a while, so even unarmed they make a good early military.</p>
                <p align="left">Ghouls might migrate to your fort, or you turn captured invaders or prisoners into new ghouls in your Corruption Chamber. Or you stitch a second head onto them, or add two additional arms. Or both.</p>
                <p align="left">Ghouls can be turned into powerful, but uncontrollable Thralls in the Thrall Chamber. </p>

                <p align="left"> <img src="icons/soul wisp.PNG" width="14" height="16" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Soul Wisp</strong>: For one soul you can summon a Soul Wisp in the Necromantic Shrine. They die very quickly, but are great to spot ambushes. They make nearby enemies sleepy and slow them down.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <p align="left"><img src="icons/pain elemental 2t.png" width="16" height="16" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Pain Elemental</strong>: The upgrade to a Soul Wisp. You can summon one from a soul, a bone and a gem in the Necromantic Shrine. They also die quickly, but explode into fire.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <p align="left"><img src="icons/monolith.png" width="16" height="16" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Black Monolith</strong>: With 10 blocks and a totem you can build it in the Necromantic Shrine. It resurrects all corpses around it in a 15 tile radius.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <p align="left"><img src="icons/nightmare.PNG" width="17" height="16" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Nightmare</strong>: A firebreathing horse. Bought from the demonic attorney.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <p align="left"><img src="icons/bloodbeast.png" width="16" height="16" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Bloodbeast</strong>: A supreme warrior made of blood. Made in the southern library section, which specialises in blood magic.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <p align="left"><img src="icons/armorman.PNG" width="14" height="16" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Animated Armor</strong>: A truly tough bastard. Made from a full set of armor, a shield and either a sword or a mace at the Enchanter.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <p align="left"><img src="icons/crystal.png" width="16" height="16" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Control Pylon</strong>: Constructed in the Soul Syphon, from 1 soul and 1 large gem. </p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <p align="left"> All Pylons and Warlocks control Skeletons within 25 tiles, line-of-sight. Pylons need some connection to Warlocks, who power them. Skeletons in range move 2.5 times faster.</p>
                <p align="left">Since all this is difficult to explain with text alone, here a picture (not to scale) : <img src="icons/crystal3.PNG" width="709" height="230" alt="harbinger" /></p>
                <p align="left">The Warlock on the left has line-of-sight to a pylon and a skeleton. He controls them. The Pylon then powers and controls nearby skeletons and pylons. The Pylon to the right is useless, since it has no power.</p>
                <p align="left">You can identify a powered pylon ingame by its blinking cyan 'P'. Pylons can power other Pylons through walls, as long as its 25 tiles.</p>
                <p align="left">If all Warlocks die, all pylons will power down after a few weeks. </p>
                <p align="left">If  a Skeleton slows down, simply bringing a powered Pylon or a Warlock near it will bring it back under your control. </p>
<hr align="left" />
                <h1 align="left"><a name="nn" id="dd2">Nobles</a></h1>
                <p align="left">Warlock nobles are way different from what you are used to.</p>
                <p align="left">Only Warlocks  can become nobles, with the exception of the lowly Steward and the militia captians. You can appoint all nobles from the very beginning, but they require rooms and furniture, most of them wont to labors, and they have mandates and demands. Take care not to anger them.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Steward</strong>: You start the dungeon with this noble. He or she can be of any race, even a Skeleton or Ghoul, and requires nothing but a meager office. He will talk to foreign diplomats and run the mundane parts of the dungeon. <em>// I would have liked to get rid of this, but one elected noble is necessary in the game, no way around it, to appoint all following nobles. He has no special graphics.</em></p>
                <p align="left"><img src="icons/harbinger.PNG" width="30" height="33" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Overlord</strong>: The leader of your dungeon.  He will lead a squad of up to 100 soldiers. He has 3 demands and 3 mandates and requires full suits of rooms, offices, dining room and tombs,  cant be punished. He runs the minion raids in the Throne Room. This is your best source of prisoners.</p>
                <p align="left"><em>//due to DF being very stubborn, any Warlock can be the Overlord noble, but I recommend to use the Overlord caste you make in the  Throne Room for this position</em>.</p>
                <p align="left"><img src="icons/fleshmonger.PNG" width="32" height="34" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Fleshmonger</strong>: Your doctor. He  runs  your hospital. He needs an office, dining room, bedroom and tomb; he has 1 demand and 1 mandate. </p>
                <p align="left"><img src="icons/keeper.PNG" width="30" height="33" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Keeper of Knowledge</strong>: Takes care of your books. He acts like your broker, bookkeeper and manager in one. He needs an office, dining room, bedroom and tomb; he has 1 demand and 1 mandate,  and won't do physical labor.</p>
                <p align="left"><img src="icons/mistress.PNG" width="30" height="32" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Mistress</strong>: Can only be female. Acts as your law enforcer and executioner, using a whip as weapon of choice.  She acts like your sheriff, hammerer and psychiatrist, meeting unhappy workers to talk to them. Needs an office, dining room, bedroom and tomb; she has 1 demand and 1 mandate,</p>
                <p align="left"><img src="icons/Riders.PNG" width="127" height="32" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Death, Hunger, Pestilence and War</strong>: Four militia captians, which can lead a squad of 1 unit. Themselves. These positions should be filled with powerful mages or individual highly trained and equipped ghouls or skeletons. It is more of an atmospheric point, when you say: I had it was this FB in my caverns, I am sending Death to take it down. The Riders of the Apocalypse do not do menial labor and require a tomb.</p>
                <p align="left"><img src="icons/ghouls militia.PNG" width="32" height="32" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Ghoul Master</strong>: Your Ghoul military leader. He can lead a squad of up to 25 wrestlers and whip-using ghouls. He only requires a tomb. You can create as many as needed.</p>
                <p align="left"><img src="icons/skeleton militia.PNG" width="32" height="32" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Crypt Lord</strong>: Your Skeleton military leader. He can lead a squad of up to 25 skeletons and archers. He only requires a tomb. You can create as many as needed.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Non-Appointable: Monarch, Diplomat and Merchants. </strong></p>
                <p align="left">The monarch will lead your home-civ and might even show up in your fort. He is literally the same as a dwarven monarch, just renamed to 'Master Sorcerer'. Mostly just used for world-gen.</p>
                <p align="left">Diplomats might show up once a year and act like any other diplomat of any other civ. No changes here. They are called 'Emissary'.</p>
                <p align="left">Merchants would usually show up with caravans to trade, but warlock civs do not have access to pull animals for wagons, or pack animals to carry tradegoods, therefore your civ is always 'no-trade'. Merchants shouldnt be possible. If you do happen to see one, he will be called 'Shady Merchant'.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <h1 align="left"><a name="oo" id="dd4">The Overlord</a></h1>
                <p align="left">You can appoint one Warlock to be the boss. He gets 250% strength, toughness and endurance, and gets unique abilities. You can send a Warlock to the Throne Room to do this.</p>
                <p align="left">The Overlord casually slaps passing Warlocks to let them know whos boss. They will feel pain (and shame), but move faster for a while. </p>
                <p align="left">Once a year, 4 new minions are summoned by the Overlord automatically.</p>
                <p align="left">You will see him  running the reactions in the Throne Room. He can send minions to raiding missions and win prisoners, scalps or materials. Which may cause retaliations by the  other races.</p>
                <p align="left">If your Overlord dies, you will not be able to appoint a new one for 1 month. After that you may try to appoint another Warlock.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <h1 align="left"><a name="zz" id="aa2">Souls &amp; Scalps</a></h1>
                <p align="left">All butchered creatures will drop a soul and a scalp. Both items can't be stockpiled and only exist temporarily. They will wither or rot away after 2-4 weeks.</p>
                <p align="left">You can make souls stable by storing them in hourglasses, making so called Phylacteries. This is done in the Soul Syphon. Souls or Phylacteries are the basic currency of Warlocks and are used from raising dead, over summoning creature to powerful rituals.</p>
                <p align="left">Scalps can be made stable with the &quot;Make skin from scalp&quot; reaction in the Tanner. These race-specific skins are your materials for books or armor decorations. Dwarf-skin decorated armor helps fight dwarves for example. Books are needed for libraries, spells and learning. See the next paragraph.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <h1 align="left"><a name="yy" id="bb2">Libraries &amp; Books</a></h1>
                <p align="left">One of the main building blocks of a Warlock dungeon is the Library. There are 9 different workshops for this. You start with the Library - Center. It allows you to write books, unlocking all the other libraries. </p>
                <p align="left">Each library has a specific topic and can write 2 special books, which unlock new buildings. All workshops in the Lair and High-Ritual section need such books. If you embark on a Necromancers tower, you can even use their books to quickly build a library or two. The Academy can teach skills by using books. This is a great place to get rid of extra books, in case you already have everything unlocked.</p>
                <p align="left">You can also teach spells in the library section. See the next paragraph.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <h1 align="left"><a name="xx" id="cc2">Spells</a></h1>
                <p align="left">Spells are only for Warlocks. Each Warlock starts with the slade-boulder spell, but they can learn dozens of new spells. You assign the Warlock to the library, bring the reagents and after the reaction is finished, your Warlock will be able to cast the selected spell. </p>
                <p align="left">You will not get any notification about this, but the Dwarf Therapist should be able to show you the learned spells, they show as active syndromes. You can even teach a Warlock the same spell several times, for example if you teach him Fireball 3 times, he can cast 3 fireballs at the same time.</p>
                <p align="left">Spells cost many alchemical reagents, candles and herbs and such. Most of them come from the Alchemist. </p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <h1 align="left"><a name="alc" id="cc3">Alchemy</a></h1>
                <p align="left">Your Alchemist uses raw materials to make ritual and spell reagents. Its a very simple system: Gem Dust, Shredded Plants, Wood Splinters and Ore Dust go in, ritual reagent comes out. Usually its three things for one item. For example 3 shredded plants make 1 bag of herbs, or 3 bags of gem dust make 1 gem sigil.</p>
                <p align="left">What is this dust/shredded stuff? Its material that ended up in the shredders. You have 6 workshops in the Industry section. A sawmill, a bonemill, a wood shredder, ore shredder, plant shredder and gem shredder. Warlocks just chuck all the raw materials in, and get their reagents out. You will need a lot of bags for this.</p>
                <p align="left">In the end you simply strip-mine the entire map and throw it all in.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <h1 align="left"><a name="uu" id="cc4">Controlling Undeads</a></h1>
                <p align="left">Undead units will most likely appear sooner or later. Both uncontrollable, like animated dead, and controllable, like Skeletons. </p>
                <p align="left">Uncontrollable opposed-to-life creatures will not attack you. But they will roam the map and attack invaders, ambushes and wildlife. They are not very strong, since they use the undead hitpoint system and dont carry equipment.</p>
                <p align="left">Controlable Skeletons are a lot more interesting. They do labors and learn combat skills. You can build your own at the Necromantic Altar, but if they run too far from the Warlocks, they turn opposed-to-life as well. When that happens you need to bring a Warlock nearby to retake control. Or you build a network of Pylons, which is explained in the Warlock-Section of the manual.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <h1 align="left"><a name="rr" id="cc3">Raiding</a></h1>
                <p align="left">A good source of scalps and souls are raids. In your Throne Room you can appoint an Overlord, who can in turn command his minions to do raids. This is all done in reactions, there are no actual minions involved. You can pick a target and a command, and watch the show. In the end you will be rewarded with either loot, prisoners or scalps.</p>
                <p align="left">Raiding only needs some raiding kits from the Craftsmans Shop, and some piece of intel. Where do you get intel? I am glad you asked. See the Prisoner Section below.</p>
                <hr align="left" />
                <h1 align="left"><a name="ww" id="dd5">Prisoners</a></h1>
                <p align="left">Prisoners are live creatures and count as pets. You can butcher them for scalps, meat and souls, but you have an entire industry based on them: The Dungeon. It consists of four workshops; the Interrogation Room, the Corruption Chamber, the Dungon Cell and the Execution Chamber.</p>
                <p align="left">You can strip-search your prisoners to look for hidden items or intel, or torture them to reveal more info. You can identify that info in the Interrogation Room and see if it is any help for your raids. You might get valuable info about a caravan, church, village, town or castle this way.</p>
                <p align="left">Prisoners are injured by being tortured, and you might want to try to heal them up now and then. The Dungeon Cell allows just that, as well as feeding them. </p>
                <p align="left">The Execution Chamber makes a quick end of them, spawning a free Pain Elemental, or you bissect the prisoner into bodyparts. These can be butchered or used to augment Ghouls.</p>
              <p align="left">In the end you do raids, get prisoners, torture them, get intel, do better raids, get more prisoners, rinse and repeat. You will always have to ask yourself: Should I butcher the prisoner now, or try one more time for more intel? </p></td>
