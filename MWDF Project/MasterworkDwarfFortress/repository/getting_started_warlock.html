        <p>Warlocks are very different from other civs. Your main resource will be corpses. Their bodies give you bones and meat, and their souls can be sold to demons or used in spells. Blood allows bloodwine, ink and summonings. Bones are used for armors and weapons, or to assemble more skeletons for your army. And corpses... corpses wont stay dead for long in this mod.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>The Embark</u></strong></p>
        <p>You chose a nice site, just as always. Bonus points for embarking on a tomb or necromancers tower, which will be friendly to you. Just press SHIFT+E on the map to embark on them. Evil biomes are also good for you, since the undeads will protect you and your evil minions are immune to most evil weather. You might have a problem butchering corpses and getting souls/bones in evil biomes.</p>
        <p>The early game will be much easier than with dwarves, because your skeletons dont need anything, and wildlife is barely any danger to your minions at all.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>The Embark Preparation</u></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Skills</strong>: Warlocks can learn Researching, Writing, Praying, Gem Setting/Cutting, Herbalism, Alchemy and Chemistry. Ghouls and Skeletons learn no labor skills, so getting correct skill points is rather important. You can later teach skeletons skills in workshops. I would recommend to take a lot of miners, masons and woodcutters. Maybe a few combat skills as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Items</strong>: Some food and drinks for the Warlocks and Ghouls. Thats really all you need. Bonesaws and Picks can be made in the Boneforge early on, and getting bones is easy. You can buy large amounts of raw materials, or enough metalworking related items to start first thing on armor and weapons.</p>
        <p><strong>Pets</strong>: You can buy prisoners that you farm for food, or mephits, tiny scaly minions that do your bidding. See the pet section for more info.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>First things on the map</u></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Nobles</strong>: Your Steward is automatically elected. He appoints the other nobles. You can also make a Ghoul or Skeleton squad, using the Cryptlord or Ghoulmaster militia captians. Use them for hunting. Appointing a Keeper of Knowledge will net you a bookkeeper, broker and manager, but he requires some rooms and furniture.</p>
        <p><strong>Workshops</strong>: A mason, a carpenter, a craftsman. Butcher and Tanner. Next to them: The Soul Syphon, to preserve souls by using hourglasses. Once you have 3 full phylacteries (hourglass with soul), build a Ethereal Gate. It allows free furniture and blocks.</p>
        <p>With rooms done, you can start hunting wildlife and butchering the corpses to get more bones and souls. Build a Necromantic Shrine as soon as you have the needed souls. You can build more skeletons and other minions there.</p>
        <p>Build an Inscriptor to raise the skill of your Skeletons. Use them for your crafting skills. A tailor can easily make leather armor for all, the boneforge makes bone armor set.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>Safety</u></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Wall-in(?)</strong>: Some sort of protective area for your Warlocks wouldnt be too bad, but overall is much better to allow your Ghoul and Skeletons squads to reach targets quickly. You need those souls.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>Advancing</u></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Pylons</strong>:  Build a network of Pylons at the Soul Syphon to establish control across the map. This allows your skeletons to work at full speed, 2.5 times faster than without.</p>
        <p><strong>Shredders</strong>: All Warlock-specific workshops need raw materials. In the beginning its souls and bones. But for higher tier things you need special reagents, made from strip mining the entire map. The shredders can turn plants, ores, woods and gems into these materials. Just chuck everything in.</p>
        <p><strong>Alchemy</strong>: The Alchemist is very important to advance. It takes the raw materials from the shredders and make ritual reagents from it, which are used to learn spells and do rituals in workshops.</p>
        <p><strong>Libraries</strong>: You need a lot of glue from bones/horn and paper/vellum from wood/leather to write books. It takes about 80 books to finish all the libraries, which gives your Warlocks something to do: Learning spells and writing special books. The spells make them better in combat, while the books unlock the best workshops you have.</p>
        <p><strong>Raiding</strong>: Your Overlord can command raids on targets that net you Prisoners, Goods or Scalps. Prisoners can further be searched, questioned and tortured for more information on better targets. Rinse, repeat, and make some profit.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>What then?</u></strong></p>
        <p>This is up to you. You can build cagetraps and convert invaders in your Torture Chamber. Or use the High-Tier workshops to curse them with lycanthropie or turn them into thralls. The Darkpact allows deals with demons, or transform your fort into a vampire den, or make a maze full of animated weapons and armors. There is lots to discover.<br />

<p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time, averaging 5 per female.  If you're not careful, they may attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their numbers quickly enough.</p>
<p><br />
  - PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate area.  If they realize that they are the majority, they will rebel.  It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they are the majority.  This has no visible effect at first.</p>
<p><br />
  - A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.  They will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping creatures.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like vampires.  This effect lasts for half a year after the rebellion actually starts.</p>
<p><br />
  - PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run away.  Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once, so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly outnumbered.</p>
<p><br />
  - Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going berserk.  Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were not the actual target.</p>
<p><br />
  - Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance of inflicting necrosis on themselves.  This will generate miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
<p><br />
  - PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture, because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
<p><br />
  - Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
<p><br />
  - Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is now docile.  However, they may choose to attack one on their own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the ones that made a kill).</p>
<p><br />
  - Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
<p><br />
  - The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the dwarves that pass by.  Large numbers of tame animals can also prevent PHM from rebelling.  Separating them into small groups can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of guards that have been in combat.  Or you could go the simplest method: just eat them!</p></div></td>
