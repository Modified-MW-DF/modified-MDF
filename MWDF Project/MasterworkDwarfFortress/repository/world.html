      <p>Adding so much new content means that the mod features overwhelm the standard worldgen. It's recommended to generate a world using the advanced world generator, which already includes several templates that are optimized for the mod. They are created with PerfectWorld and have very specific themes each. If you want to make new and exciting world yourself, have a look at the utility and be sure to upload the new content to the forums for other people to enjoy!</p>
      <p>You have several generic small/medium/large region and islands, and 9 unique worlds, and a new arena map.</p>
      <p><strong>Arena</strong></p>
      <p align="left">The new arena consists out of many small cells that should ease the testing of several groups of enemies. It can be toggled in the GUI and is on by default.</p>

      <p><strong>Garden of Gaia</strong></p>
      <p>The Garden of Gaia is a world with many mixed biomes. You can easily find normal, good and evil within one embark square. It is designed to give you the maximum in race- and creature-diversity. Due to the high factor of randomness please mind the sometimes erratic metal and soil distribution. The closer you get to the lake in the center, the less savage the country gets.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/world_gaia.JPG" alt="worldmap" width="518" height="525" align="middle" /></p>
      <p><strong>Gears of War</strong></p>
      <p>Shaped like a gear, this map makes for isolated islands and very different shores. Most areas are either good aligned or evil aligned, and most civs will settle on the ring around the lake. Trading and sieging is difficult on this map, which makes the Embassy workshop very important. </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/world_gears.PNG" width="515" height="514" alt="worldmap" /></p>
      <p><strong>Geomagic</strong></p>
      <p>A prison of rock and water, Geomagic consists of a spherical island full of rivers and 8 good/evil biomes that are interlocked. You are surrounded by a large ocean with small land-bridges to the mountains on the corners. This map offers a good variety of biomes and is a good starting point for new users. </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/world_geomagic.PNG" width="515" height="515" alt="worldmap" /></p>
      <p><strong>Icy Myr</strong></p>
      <p>Icy Myr mostly consists of glaciers and mountains. A difficult embark indeed. You can find several Volcanoes to ease the melting of water. Most civs will settle in the green and warm south. It can still be that some civs wont survive the harsh climate, so don't be surprised if you have less allies or invaders then expected.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/world_icy.JPG" width="510" height="488" alt="worldmap" /></p>
      <p><strong>Mandelbrot</strong></p>
      <p>Mandelbrot consists of a large ocean with many small islands and wall of mountains around it. The map is warm and tropical in the north, and gets colder the further south you go, with a high amoung of lakes, rivers and palms. Hundrets of volcanos are scattered around the landscape.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/world_mandelbrot.PNG" width="516" height="507" alt="worldmap" /></p>
      <p><strong>Blessed Serra</strong></p>
      <p>Blessed Serra is an easy world. You will not find evil biomes here, only good ones. Plenty of rivers and volcanoes to help you on the way. It ranges from Mountains to Ocean, with most civs settled on the coast. The Area around the lake in the north-west is savage.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/world_serra.JPG" width="540" height="568" alt="worldmap" /></p>
      <p><strong>Scorching Shiv</strong></p>
      <p>Scorching Shiv is a desert world. You will find many mountains, hills and dunes, but only few areas with grass, water or trees. Most friendly civs will settle in the north, through the mountain pass. You will find many volcanoes in this map, to counterbalance the lack of trees. Due to the high volcanism conventional fuel is rare. The further south-west you go into the desert, the more savage the area gets.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/world_shiv.JPG" width="535" height="503" alt="worldmap" /></p>
      <p><strong>Remote Tolaria</strong></p>
      <p>Tolaria is designed to allow isolated plays on small islands. You might have one ally, or one invader race, but you can check the access to those before you embark. Otherwise you can find everything from Mountains to Forest to Ocean on this map. Most civs will settle on the big island. The further away you go from it, the higher the level of savaragy gets. </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/world_tolaria.JPG" width="534" height="556" alt="worldmap" /></p>
      <p><strong>Cursed Urborg</strong></p>
      <p>Cursed Urbog is difficult. You will only find evil biomes here, no good ones. Most civs have a hard time surviving this worldgen, so don't be surprised if you have 1 or 2 allies less then usual. The region is mountainous in the west and has a coastline in the east. Savagery is high. Due to the swamp and drainage level this map has less flux and metal then other worldgens. Have fun.</p>
