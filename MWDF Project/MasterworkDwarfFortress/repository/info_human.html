		<td width="798"><h1>Humans </h1>
			<p align="left"><strong>Skills:</strong> Human skills are the same as dwarven skills. There is nothing special you have to look out for. Just keep in mind that you are doing a lot of constructions aboveground; masons, woodcutters and carpenters will come in handy for that.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Combat: </strong>Humans are slightly larger than dwarves and average in combat. They have no special attacks, skills or magic, so just equip your soldiers well and train them in the barracks, business as usual.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Weapons:</strong> You have a large assortement of weapons, but the human speciality are muskets, pistols and hand-cannons. For early ranged weaponry you have the standard bow.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Ammo:</strong> Arrows, Arrows, Bullets and Cannon-balls. </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Armor:</strong> You have the normal leather and metal armors known from dwarf mode.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Materials:</strong> There are no special materials that humans exclusively use. Just go with iron and steel for the most parts. Gold is the material that makes the world go round, its the most important metal. Gold coins buy everything.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Pets:</strong> Human have access to all vanilla DF pets. Cows, horses, dogs, cats, turkeys and so on. The farmers guild can even help to breed more war-animals.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Food:</strong> Human eat most everything and are in that aspect exactly like dwarves. No special care needed.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Drink:</strong> Humans are not alcohol dependant, water is perfectly fine. Expensive and varied drinks will raise their mood, so dont disregard your brewery.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Digging:</strong> Dark and claustrophobic underground tunnels leave negative effects on humans. After 1 ingame week they get a 50% speed malus, because of the dark, and if left for several weeks underground they get dizzy. They also get the regular cave adaption, if left far too long under the earth, they get nauseated and puke once they come back into the sunlight. Build aboveground constructions or build a lot of skylights to negate these effects. </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Embark:</strong> Nothing special here. Take some pets, seeds, maybe wood or stone, pick and axe. Very vanilla DF like. There are no mod specific items you need to start as humans.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Nobles:</strong> Your noblemen are the same as the dwarven nobles, you dont need to learn anything new. Tiny name changes happened, for example the Expedition Leader is the Caravan Leader now, and the Chief Medical Dwarf is the Chief of Medicine, and the Liaison is the Guild Represantative. There is a single addition however, the Bureaucrats. They are brokers and bookkeepers and managers in one, and you can make as many as you like. Never again should a caravan leave, because your one broker is busy.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Magic:</strong> Human dont do magic much. You might have very rare migrants that found a secret in worldgen, besides that there are no supernatural powers. Your foreign necromancer and succubus traders might have a few spells for you though. </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Tech:</strong> The epitome of your technology are blackpowder weapons. Pistols, Muskets, Hand-Cannons and Wildfire bombs/ballista ammo. </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Caste System:</strong> Humans have 31 castes. Sounds a lot, but is very simple: 2 castes for male and female peasants. 24 castes for male and female guildmembers. 5 castes for special adventurers you may find in your migrants, the Warrior, the Ranger, the Barbarian, the Cleric and the Monk.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Warrior</li>
				<li>The warrior has 5 points in shield, armor and sword skill and 10 in melee combat. He has above average strength and endurance.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Ranger</li>
				<li>The ranger has 10 points in ranged combat and hunting, and 5 points in bow usage. He has above average agility.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Barbarian</li>
				<li>The barbarian has 10 points in axe combat and dodging, has above average strength and endurance, can enter combat trances, feels no fear.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Monk</li>
				<li>The monk has 15 skill points in striking, kicking and dodging, as well as 10 in praying. He is sterile and never fathers kids. He has above average focus and spatial sense.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Cleric</li>
				<li>The cleric has 3 points in all medical skills as well as hammer combat.	Thats not important in combat, but a hospital run by her will be twice as effective.</li>
			</ul>
			<p align="left"><strong>Important stuff:</strong> Trade. Open Quarry. Money. If you keep this as a guideline, your human town should flourish. You need caravans from other civs, you get a merchants guild and call special traders. You cant go underground too much, so mine layer by layer, keeping your miners in the open. And sell all the unnecessary goods, print all your copper, silver and gold to coins and rent out as many workshops as you can. </p>
			<p align="left">Just keep in mind that vanilla DF has <strong>one</strong> invader race, Goblins. MasterworkDF has <strong>sixteen</strong>. This means a lot more !FUN!, snatchers, thieves, sieges and ambushes. Again, these are optional. You can even add another <strong>fifteen </strong>fortress defence races to it.</p>
