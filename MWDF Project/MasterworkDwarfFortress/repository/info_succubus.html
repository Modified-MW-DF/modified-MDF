<p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time, averaging 5 per female.&nbsp; If you're not careful, they may attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their numbers quickly enough.</p>
<p><br /> - PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate area.&nbsp; If they realize that they are the majority, they will rebel.&nbsp; It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they are the majority.&nbsp; This has no visible effect at first.</p>
<p><br /> - A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
<p><br /> - Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.&nbsp; They will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
<p><br /> - Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping creatures.</p>
<p><br /> - Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like vampires.&nbsp; This effect lasts for half a year after the rebellion actually starts.</p>
<p><br /> - PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run away.&nbsp; Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once, so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly outnumbered.</p>
<p><br /> - Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going berserk.&nbsp; Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were not the actual target.</p>
<p><br /> - Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
<p><br /> - Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance of inflicting necrosis on themselves.&nbsp; This will generate miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
<p><br /> - PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
<p><br /> - Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture, because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
<p><br /> - Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
<p><br /> - Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is now docile.&nbsp; However, they may choose to attack one on their own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the ones that made a kill).</p>
<p><br /> - Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
<p><br /> - The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the dwarves that pass by.&nbsp; Large numbers of tame animals can also prevent PHM from rebelling.&nbsp; Separating them into small groups can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of guards that have been in combat.&nbsp; Or you could go the simplest method: just eat them!</p>

<h1 align="left">Succubi</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">The succubi are human sized creatures will demonic properties. They escaped the abyss at the beginning and history and enjoyed the freedom the surface gave them. The love wandering geat palaces where gem windows meet finely decorated furniture and producing the most exquisite works of art imaginable, as long as your share their vision of art. But in the underground lies complex dungeons, where the succubi perform dark rituals.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The race has an heavy gender inbalance or 9 females to 1 male. This leads to your fort getting few children to take care of. However, you should be careful to protect married couples and their children as a tragedy can lead to simultaneous tantrums.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Gameplay wise, the civilization is between dwarves and warlocks. You will be able to upgrade your fighters with powerful spells, and use creatures specialized for military or civilian uses. Production and management however is similar to a standard vanilla game.</p> 
<p style="text-align: left;">Civilian succubi are lazy and will take long breaks, but their good intelligence will let them produce fine goods for you. Their short temper, however, will make raising mood a priority. If tantrum spirals are less likely,&nbsp;fights can break out easily. As an alternative to migrants, they can turn other races into half breeds using the Den of Iniquity. In addition to the basic succubi attributes, converted prisoners retain perks from their former race. Converted prisoners always join your civilization immediatly.</p> 
<h2><strong>Skills</strong></h2><p align="left">The succubi are exceptionnaly good at several skills, learning those at an increased rate depending of their former race. A pure sucubi does not have the same advantages than a former dwarf or human for example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure succubi learn sorcery and animal training quickly.</li>
<li>Cambions (elf) &nbsp;are good ambushers and archers but not great miners.</li>
<li>Devils (human) &nbsp;are good traders.</li>
<li>Fiends (dwarf) are good mechanics, &nbsp;miners and melee fighters, they are also immune to antracite dust, but are bad sorcerers.</li>
<li>Hellions (goblin) are good lashers but bad sorcerers.</li>
<li>Imps (kobold) are great dodgerss, knife users, swimmers and ambushers but have a small frame and are bad animal trainers.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><strong>Combat:&nbsp;</strong> The succubi have good strength and great agility, but their endurance is lacking. They hit quickly in battle, landing crippling blows before their enemies have the time to react. As a result there is a huge difference between a badly trained warrior and a legendary fighter. Their poor focus on the other hand make them average archers at best. They do not bite, instead using health draining kisses, injecting a dimming venom.</p><h2><strong>Pets</strong></h2>
<ul style="text-align: left;"></ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pets are an important feature for the civ. You will&nbsp;have a choice of creatures at the embark screen including underground creatures plus a few select demonic entities. All those creatures can be summoned in your fort by building a summoning circle and seeking the items required for their arrival.</p><p style="text-align: left;">For more information of each available pet, <a href="pets_succubus.html">see the pets section</a>.</p><h2><strong>Nobles</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Queen, baron, count, duke,</span> the usual nobles. They contribute little besides issuing mandates ... for now.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Leader / Mistress</span>, the selected leader of your dungeon, they will conduct meetings with unhappy workers and diplomats.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lady of Pain</span>, the leader of your military, you might need her quickly, but you will be hard pressed to meet her standards. Treat her well and she will be happy to terminate your enemies.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Battle guides</span> will lead your military squads under the command of the lady of pain. They will all ask for an assigned tomb so their names and feats are remembered.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enforcer / Guardian,</span> the lawgiver of your dungeon. She will manage you jail as usual. When 50 succubi have settled inside the walls, the guardian can build a squad to keep the tiny order a dungeon full of demon can support.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Whipper</span>s handle capital punishment. When she is not whipping criminals, she will&nbsp; 'deal' with unhappy workers to help her mistress.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keeper of secrets</span>, the manager and book keeper in the same role. This position is usually given to the most shy succubus who has no issue disappearing for months in her office.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attorney</span>, the assigned broker and merchant. In truth the one who can afford to speak with orcs, goblins and drows. She will measure your wealth and will sell your unwanted items, once she is done drinking, sleeping and partying.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Magic</strong></h2><p align="left"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Magic is learned one skill at a time at the Temple of Sin or Fire. Use the workshop profile to select who will get the upgrade then run the associated reaction to give your succubus the new interactions. Remeber to put the military off duty if you are trying to upgrade a soldier. Many spells being fire based, it is a good idea to grant fire immunity to your pyromancer, this is done at the Temple of Fire.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, there is global effects ran into the Abyssal Temple or the Esoteric Order, timing those reactions will make a difference between victory or a crushed fort.</p>
<h2><strong>Tech</strong></h2><p align="left">The more advanced buildings have a multitude of sources. Some require magma, others blueprints or special items traded using the Attorney's stock. You can spawn magma using a magma well, operated by a fireborn succubus, this will enable the construction of magma forges.</p>
<h2><strong>Important stuff</strong></h2><p align="left">You will be attacked early. Very early! So start preparing defences immediatly! Otherwise you must be playing with temperature ON. I also recommend disabling diseases as there is currently&nbsp;no means to fight those.</p>
<p align="left">Just keep in mind that vanilla DF has&nbsp;<strong>one</strong>&nbsp;invader race, Goblins. MasterworkDF has&nbsp;<strong>sixteen</strong>. This means up a lot more !FUN!,snatcher, thieves, sieges and ambushes. Again, these are optional. You can even add another&nbsp;<strong>fifteen</strong>fortress defence races to it.</p>
