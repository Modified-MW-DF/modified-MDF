			<p><strong>Before you embark:</strong></p>
			<p>You can give skills, buy items and pets. There is no perfect setup, it depends on how you want to play. I personally would recommend taking some animals, especially cheaper ones like poultry and cats and a breeding pair of dogs. I dont often spend points on skills, but if you do you might want to favor the woodcutter to clear the surface area for you buildings, as well as a miner or two, to get raw materials and dig a moat. I recommend giving skills to military units, 5 points in a weapon skill, 5 points in dodging. A single appraisal skill for your broker also goes a long way.</p>
			<p>Food is important, drinks not so much, as humans do not depend on alcohol. Especially if you supplement your food through fishing and hunting you can mostly ignore it all together. Taking surface plant seeds is useful, especially if you want to start a textile and dye production.		</p>
			<p>Most of the points I spend on raw materials. Boulders for items, wood logs for contructions and coke, even gold bearing rock for 90 points might be worth an investement for some early coins.</p>
			<p><strong>After the embark:</strong></p>
			<p>You have arrived with your 7 settlers and your pets. Remember that you cant just dig underground, because your units dont like dark cave-like rooms. You should start clearing the forest and producing blocks as soon as possible. Building a community building for the beds and dining room, or even single huts for each unit should be considered. </p>
			<p>A moat or wall will protect you from the worst dangers, while you decide which path your town should go. You should build local merchant stalls quickly and start selling good to get money, which you can spend on new items, materials and upgrades. Here the most important ones for an early fort:</p>
			<p>Merchants Guild: Unlocks calling race-specific caravans, which is the basis for several merchant stalls and workshops.</p>
			<p>Engineers Guild: Unlocks coin mint, for your own money production.</p>
			<p>Masons Guild: Brick oven is very helpful for aboveground constructions, if you mine for materials.</p>
			<p>Carpenters Guild: Sawmill is very helpful for aboveground constructions, if you cut wood for materials.</p>
			<p>Guilds for later use are the Clothiers for high-value tradegoods, Smiths for better metals and weapons/armors, Tanners for leather upgrades and Academics Guild for blackpowder, unlocking pistols, muskets and cannons. Keep in mind that early game you may only have the room available for one or two guildhalls, and that you may need to expand your territory later to make room for more.</p>
			<p>A small part of your units should be put into the military, while an equally sized part should pray on the Altars. The more you pray, the better is your standing with the gods, which will interefere in the game and might help your fortress in many different ways. If you stop praying, the gods will lose their power over time.</p>
			<p><strong>Late-Game:</strong></p>
			<p>Unlock all 40 race-specific workshops, workers, merchants, stages and universities for access to a vast array of different materials, items and pets, building a giant castle overlooking your walled-off town. Your quarry should be deep enough to let light shine into the caverns, and cannons stand proudly on top of your multi-tiered walls. Guard squads with muskets patrol the streets, while a steady stream of caravans goes in and out your gates. At least thats the best case scenario. If you let sieges get the better of you, cutting of trade routes, you lose access to most foreign tech quickly.</p>
