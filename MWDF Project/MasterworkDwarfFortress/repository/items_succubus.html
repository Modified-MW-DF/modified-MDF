<h1>Plump Helmet Men</h1>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time,
averaging 5 per female.&nbsp; If you're not careful, they may
attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their
numbers quickly enough.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate
area.&nbsp; If they realize that they are the majority, they will
rebel.&nbsp; It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they
are the majority.&nbsp; This has no visible effect at first.</p>
<p><br />
- A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.&nbsp; They
will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping
creatures.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like
vampires.&nbsp; This effect lasts for half a year after the
rebellion actually starts.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the
creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run
away.&nbsp; Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once,
so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly
outnumbered.</p>
<p><br />
- Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going
berserk.&nbsp; Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were
not the actual target.</p>
<p><br />
- Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance
of inflicting necrosis on themselves.&nbsp; This will generate
miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture,
because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
<p><br />
- Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky
strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they
will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
<p><br />
- Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is
now docile.&nbsp; However, they may choose to attack one on their
own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the
ones that made a kill).</p>
<p><br />
- Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
<p><br />
- The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture
them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the
dwarves that pass by.&nbsp; Large numbers of tame animals can also
prevent PHM from rebelling.&nbsp; Separating them into small groups
can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of
guards that have been in combat.&nbsp; Or you could go the simplest
method: just eat them!</p>

<h2><strong>Weapons</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Lasher weapons : Whips (blunt) and bladed whips
(edged).</li>
<li>Piercing : Pitchforks, can be upgraded at the soul
forge for more strength and ranged attacks.</li>
<li>Blades : Large daggers, duel swords, long swords and
claymore.</li>
<li>Axes : Double edged axes and great axes.</li>
<li>Ranged : Recurve bows for general support, stygian
pitchforks can fire special shards that can explode or causes syndromes.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Ammo</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Arrows</li>
<li>Spell shard : Does less damage than ammo but special
ones can be made at the soul forge.</li>
<ul>
<li>Force shard : causes a cave in effect, knocking
creatures out.</li>
<li>Blight shard : creates severe necrosis clouds</li>
<li>Pain shard : inflict pain to the affect creatures</li>
<li>Make sure you properly set up the ammo in your
military screen. Do not let your warriors train with special shard!</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Armor</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Standard gauntlets, boots and helmet.</li>
<li>Corsets for the body. Those does not protect well but
can be worn at the same time as a leather armor or a stolen breastplate.</li>
<li>You can make chain mails from metal or bodysuits from
leather for an additional layer of protection.</li>
<li>Round shields. Setting the uniform on shield/buckler
will let the succubi pick better shields from fallen enemies.</li>
</ul><h2>Improving armor</h2>Several armor pieces like breastplates,
greaves or high tier shields can not be built by the succubi. You can
instead take it from (dead) invaders. Non decorated pieces can be
improved at the soul forge. The increase in quality in doing so it tied
to the worker's armorsmith skill, a legendary giving a guaranted
masterpiece. You can only upgrade such a piece once as it will be
decorated with soul gems in the process.<br /><h3>Civilian clothes</h3>All
the succubi civs have access to corsets, skirts and stockings. There is
a low chance that the civilization also have access to head veils,
masks, gloves, mittens, sandals and pants.<br /><br />Due to their...
specific culture, the succubi are not affected by the lack clothing
unlike the other races. This means that you can set a military uniform
to 'replace clothing' even if it is incomplete. Remember still that
footwear is still important to avoid contaminants.</td>
