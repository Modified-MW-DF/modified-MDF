<h1 id="topic1">Welcome to Masterwork Dwarf Fortress!</h1>
<p>This is the manual that will serve as a guide during your adventures in Masterwork. You can dive into a new game by following the links above, or use the nav-bar on the left to get a more thorough look at a specific section of the mod.</p>
<p>Under <strong><em>Welcome to MDF</em></strong> you will find everything you need to know to get started quickly and dive straight into a new way of playing Dwarf Fortress. Reading these will give you an overview of the mod, help you get started with generating a world, choosing a civilization, and give an explanation of the launcher GUI.</p>
<p>In the <strong><em>Raw Additions</em></strong> subsection you can find a thorough look into the changes Masterwork makes to the Dwarf Fortress raw files. This currently covers wild creatures, civilizations new and old, new inorganic materials, changes to grass types, additional plants, and a brief overview of the various tilesets included within Masterwork.</p>
<p><strong><em>Extra Content</em></strong> is home to guides and links for third-party applications prepackaged with Masterwork. Here, you can also find tips, known bugs and workarounds, read player-submitted stories, and spice up your desktop with Dwarf Fortress inspired wallpapers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Playable Civilizations</em></strong> have their information compiled under each race-specific section. This gives a more thorough overview of each race's unique playstyle, including invaluable information about the strengths, weaknesses, and specific needs you should be aware of. Vanilla has one playable race, Masterwork has <em>six</em>!</p>
